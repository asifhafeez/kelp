## Analysis

This was one of my favourite projects. We were given the task of re-creating Yelp using Ruby on Rails. 

I found rails worked well in our team dynamic and the project was the perfect size for a weeks worth of work. Unfortunately, we struggled with Bootstrap and CSS and did not manage to implement the styling we wanted on all of the pages. I hope to go back to this project and brush up on the styling elements in the future because the back-end is well structured.

Our successes include fantastic test coverage, brilliant back-end work on the models and a fantastic team dynamic. The latter of which included us following agile methodologies and ensuring daily stand ups, alongside semi-regular retros.
